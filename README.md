👋 Hi, I’m @superojla!

👀 I’m interested in technical documentation, especially in docs as code approach, and in different tools for creating and publishing docs.

🌱 I’m constantly learning what I can do to improve developer docs, which are my main area of interest. I'm also strongly focused on finding solutions to make content creators' (be it a TW, dev, or PM...) lives easier. I'm also learing Korean as a hobby.

✨ As a neurodivergent person, I'm a big advocate for accessibility in documentation and software development.

📫 How to reach me: @supersowa on Telegram, justisztyper@gmail.com for emails.
