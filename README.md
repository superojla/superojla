- 👋 Hi, I’m @superojla!
- 👀 I’m interested in technical documentation, especially in docs as code approach, and in different tools for creating and publishing docs.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning what I can do to make API docs creation process better, how to make software and documentation more accessible, and figuring out figuring out how to make content creator's (be it TW, dev, PM...) life easier. I'm also learing Korean as a hobby.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting documentation projects :)
- 📫 How to reach me: @supersowa on Telegram.
