- 👋 Hi, I’m @superojla!
- 👀 I’m interested in technical documentation, especially in docs as code approach, and in different tools for creating and publishing docs.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning what I can use to generate API documentation, how to improve doc structure. I'm also learing Korean as a hobby.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting documentation projects :)
